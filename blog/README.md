## Content Model

1. Posts

To create a post, just provide the following object model:

```json
{
  "name": "Post",
  "fields": {
    "title": "Post Title",
    "headerImgur": "header Image Link",
    "headerBackgroundColor": "#66ccff",
    "tags": "tag1, tag2, tag3",
    "url": "awesome-post",
    "createdDate": "new Date() or other dayjs supported datetime value",
    "content": "your markdown content",
    "jueJinLikeIconLink": "掘金 Badge Icon Url",
    "jueJinPostLink": "掘金 Post Url"
  }
}
```

There are two configurable headers, [Homepage](https://calpa.me) and [tags page](https://calpa.me/tags/).

```json
{
  "name": "Headers",
  "fields": {
    "purpose": "Tags or Home",

    "titleVisible": "Do you want to show your title in the header?",
    "subTitle": "Display a smaller wordings",
    "subTitleVisible": "Do you want to show a smaller wordings in the header?"
  }
}
```

## Deploy

[Calpa's blog](https://calpa.me) is currently using Netlify, though, you may use Github Pages as an alternative.

- Github Pages

  `npm run deploy` to deploy the blog to Github Pages

- Netlify

  Auto Deploy

## TODO

1. Update the number of post pages automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- For `window is defined`, wrap the require in check for window:

  ```JavaScript
  if (typeof window !== `undefined`) {
    const module = require("module");
  }
  ```

- `npm run reset` to clear the local cache
- Check [GatsbyJS Debugging Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/debugging-html-builds/)
