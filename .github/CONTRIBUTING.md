# Contribution Guide

Before starting, you may need to know how to contribute in a good way. You can follow the rules here:

## Code Style
Commits should follow the Angular commit message guidelines. This is because our release tool uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.

## Issues
If you encounter an issue with the Node.js library, you are welcome to submit a [bug report](https://github.com/calpa/gatsby-starter-calpa-blog/issues/new). Before that, please search for similar issues. It's possible somebody has already encountered this issue.

## Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repository, follow these steps:

- Fork the repo.
- Develop and test your code changes: `npm install`
- Commit your changes.
- Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
