Callback\\n1. Promise （思想）\\n1. Generator\\n1. Async await （推薦）\\n\\n### Callback\\n\\n我們看一下維基百科上面對於 Callback 的說明：\\n\\n> 在電腦程式設計中，回呼函式，或簡稱回呼（Callback 即call then back 被主函數呼叫運算後會返回主函數），是指通過函數參數傳遞到其它代碼的，某一塊可執行代碼的參照。這一設計允許了底層代碼呼叫在高層定義的子程式。\\n\\n這樣好像說得蠻複雜的，但其實很簡單，你把一個函數 cb (Function) 作為參數 (Argument)傳進這個函數 B 裡面，然後在函數 B 使用函數 cb。\\n\\n```\\nfunction func(x, cb) {\\n  cb(x)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n舉個例子，比如我們要在 Node.js 裡面讀取一個檔案，我們的代碼會是下面這樣的：\\n\\nhello.txt:\\n```\\nHello World, I'm Calpa Liu.\\n```\\n---\\nindex.js:\\n```\\nvar fs = require('fs');\\n\\nfs.readFile('hello.txt', function (err, data) {\\n     if (err) {\\n          return console.error(err);\\n     }\\n\\n     console.log(data);\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log('Finished');\\n```\\n\\n\\n我們會在 callback 裡面處理 callback，也就是一個回調裡面做另外一件事情，那可能是另外一個 callback，那麼你可以想象一下，我們越寫越深。。。這樣有兩個問題，第一：代碼的耦合性會很高，不容易去拆分代碼；第二：代碼的維護性很差。\\n\\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bjHDvVN.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### Promise\\n\\nPromise 是說如果你做了 A 的事情，成功了就做 B，不成功就做 C，你還可以繼續做 D 的事情，然後進行成功和不成功的處理。這樣說可能比較虛，但是你看一下 MDN 上面的圖就會明白了。\\n\\n![Promise - MDN](https://i.imgur.com/w9BxjmL.png)\\n\\n一個發射子彈的動作可以這樣寫：\\n\\n```\\nvar fire = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n     setTimeout(function() {\\n          resolve('已命中三千里外的目標');\\n     }, 3000)\\n});\\n\\nfire.then(function(result) {\\n     console.log(result);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n你可以在 Windows 平台按 F12 或 Ctrl + Shift + I，或在 Mac 上 按 Cmd + Opt + I，打開 Google Chrome Developer Tools ，然後在 Console 貼上上面的代碼，三秒後就會輸出`已命中三千里外的目標`。\\n\\n你也可以在 then() 裡面寫 1個到 N個的 Promise。\\n\\n```\\nvar fire = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n     setTimeout(function() {\\n          resolve('已命中三千里外的目標');\\n     }, 3000)\\n});\\n\\nfire.then(function(result) {\\n     console.log(result);\\n     console.log('正在返回司令部');\\n     return fire.then(function (result) {\\n          console.log(result);\\n     });\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Generator\\n\\nGenerator 其實是一個狀態機，內部保存機器的運行狀態。我們透過獲取機器的完成狀態 (done)，我們能夠重複調用機器。我們可以使用 yield 暫停一個函數，並跳出函數。從外面的角度來看，我們可以從上而下去寫代碼，但是代碼會複雜，難以理解。\\n\\n雖然它已經寫進 ECMAScript 2015 的正式規範裡面，但是我不太喜歡使用 Generator。我們簡單看一下 Generator 就好了，因為現在是 2017 年，異步操作的有更加好的處理方法。\\n\\n```\\nfunction* gen() {\\n  yield 1;\\n  yield 2;\\n  yield 3;\\n}\\n\\nvar g = gen(); // \\\"Generator { }\\\"\\ng; //\\ng.next(); // {value: 1, done: false}\\ng.next(); // {value: 2, done: false}\\ng.next(); // {value: 3, done: false}\\ng.next() // {value: undefined, done: true}\\n```\\n\\n### Async/Await\\n\\n對於技術的要求，是無止境的。為了寫出更加優美的代碼，你又可以付出什麼的代價呢？\\n\\n如果你沒有試過 Async/Await 的話，那麼你就應該試一下，因為實在是太優雅了。\\n\\n這里我就放出一段現在博客在用的代碼：\\n\\n```\\nasync const getPosts = () => {\\n  await res = axios.get('https://calpa.me/posts');\\n  return res.data;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n我們簡單的讀一下這段代碼：\\n\\n一個異步的不變量 `getPosts` 是一個箭頭函數，內部操作為等待 axios 的 GET 請求到地址：[http://calpa.me](https://calpa.me)，並返回伺服器返回的資料。\\n\\n這是一個非常簡單的異步操作吧，但是如果是這樣的呢？\\n```\\nasync const getUserData = () => {\\n  await posts = axios.get('https://calpa.me/posts');\\n  await accountInfo = axios.get('https://calpa.me/about');\\n  /* ... */\\n}\\n```\\n\\n如果你想要使用 Async / Await 的話，可以使用\\n[Node.js 7.6](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/node-76-async-await) 或以上的版本。例如使用 nvm 安裝 v8: `nvm install v8`，然後 `nvm use v8`。\\n\\n另外，如果你不想更新 Node 版本的話，你可以安裝 [async 工具庫](https://caolan.github.io/async/)。\\n\\n\\n## 感想\\n異步操作已經成為了前端工程師面試常見的問題之一，感覺是對於前端工程師的技術水平需求越來越提高了。雖然這些都是在 MDN 上面寫好的介紹，但是只有自己用過才會知道什麼比較好。\\n\\n如果公司的 Node 版本可以支持 Async/Await 的話，那就直接用 Async/Await 就好了。不行的話，那就用 Promise 吧，不然 Generator 的設計對於強迫症患者來說很不順眼。。。\\n\\n## 參考資料\\n1.

{\\n  margin-right: auto;\\n  margin-left: auto;\\n\\n  @each $breakpoint in map-keys($gutters) {\\n    @include media-breakpoint-up($breakpoint) {\\n      $gutter: map-get($gutters, $breakpoint);\\n      padding-right: ($gutter / 2);\\n      padding-left:  ($gutter / 2);\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n[map-get](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#map_get-instance_method)則是Sass裡面的一個函數，輸入一個map以及key，如果map裡面有該key的話，就會返回key的值。找不到的話就會返回null。\\n\\n#### $grid-gutter-widths (variables.scss)\\n如果沒有設置$gutters，它就會默認是[$grid-gutter-widths](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/dd0ce3e4b2a89f245ee608a1acc9f848cf8c833a/scss/_variables.scss)，以下是$grid-gutter-widths的包含的數值: xs, sm, md, lg, xl。\\n\\n```\\n$grid-gutter-width-base:     30px !default;\\n$grid-gutter-widths: (\\n  xs: $grid-gutter-width-base, // 30px\\n  sm: $grid-gutter-width-base, // 30px\\n  md: $grid-gutter-width-base, // 30px\\n  lg: $grid-gutter-width-base, // 30px\\n  xl: $grid-gutter-width-base  // 30px\\n) !default;\\n```\\n\\n#### $grid-breakpoints (variables.scss)\\n```\\n$grid-breakpoints: (\\n  xs: 0,\\n  sm: 576px,\\n  md: 768px,\\n  lg: 992px,\\n  xl: 1200px\\n) !default;\\n```\\n它定義不同設備的屏幕寬度，用於響應式設計(Responsive Web Design)。\\n#### media-breakpoint-up (breakpoints.scss)\\n而media-breakpoint-up則是在[mixins/_breakpoints.scss 第54行](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/7ca078da815320c75862b6cf25f46ce706570279/scss/mixins/_breakpoints.scss#L54)，用處是返回最短寬度的內容。\\n```\\n@mixin media-breakpoint-up($name, $breakpoints: $grid-breakpoints) {\\n  $min: breakpoint-min($name, $breakpoints);\\n  @if $min {\\n    @media (min-width: $min) {\\n      @content;\\n    }\\n  } @else {\\n    @content;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### breakpoint-min()\\n`breakpoint-min()`可以在[mixins/_breakpoints.scss 第26行](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/7ca078da815320c75862b6cf25f46ce706570279/scss/mixins/_breakpoints.scss#L26)找到，它的用處是返回最短斷點寬度或者null。\\n\\n```\\n@function breakpoint-min($name, $breakpoints: $grid-breakpoints) {\\n  $min: map-get($breakpoints, $name);\\n  @return if($min != 0, $min, null);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### row\\n#### make-row() (grid.scss)\\n```\\n@mixin make-row($gutters: $grid-gutter-widths) {\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\\n\\n  @each $breakpoint in map-keys($gutters) {\\n    @include media-breakpoint-up($breakpoint) {\\n      $gutter: map-get($gutters, $breakpoint);\\n      margin-right: ($gutter / -2);\\n      margin-left:  ($gutter / -2);\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n至於Column，我們下次再說吧。。。\\n\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Bootstrap v4

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)\\n\\n這個是個必需品吧。。。\\n\\n1. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)\\n\\n一個超級好用的 HTTP 請求工具，誰用誰知道。\\n\\n## 相關文章\\n1.

Undefined\\n1. Null\\n1. Boolean\\n1. Number\\n1. String\\n1. Symbol (ECMAScript 2015)\\n\\n## 判断方法\\n\\n我们可以透过使用`typeof`和`Object.prototype.toString()`来判断数据类型。\\n\\n### typeof\\n\\n在一开始设计 JavaScript 时，数值是由一个标签以及实际数据值表示的。对于基本类型，标签是1；而对于对象类型，标签是0。由于null代表的是空指针(里面都是0)，null的类型标签会是0。因此`typeof null`就会返回\\\"object\\\";\\n\\n```JavaScript\\ntypeof undefined; // \\\"undefined\\\"\\ntypeof Boolean;   // \\\"function\\\"\\ntypeof true;      // \\\"boolean\\\"\\ntypeof 42;        // \\\"number\\\"\\ntypeof \\\"42\\\";      // \\\"string\\\"\\ntypeof Symbol();  // \\\"symbol\\\"\\n```\\n\\n我们可以看一下ECMAScript是怎样定义typeof的：\\n\\n1. Let val be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.\\n1. If Type(val) is Reference, then\\n  a. If IsUnresolvableReference(val) is true, return \\\"undefined\\\".\\n1. Set val to ? GetValue(val).\\n1. Return a String according to Table 35.\\n\\nTable 35: typeof Operator Results\\n\\n| Typeof val | 结果     |\\n| :------------- | :------------- |\\n| Item One       | Item Two       |\\n|Type of val\\t|Result|\\n|Undefined\\t|\\\"undefined\\\"|\\n|Null|\\t\\\"object\\\"|\\n|Boolean\\t|\\\"boolean\\\"|\\n|Number|\\t\\\"number\\\"|\\n|String\\t|\\\"string\\\"|\\n|Symbol|\\t\\\"symbol\\\"|\\n|Object (ordinary and does not implement [[Call]])\\t|\\\"object\\\"|\\n|Object (standard exotic and does not implement [[Call]])\\t|\\\"object\\\"|\\n|Object (implements [[Call]])\\t|\\\"function\\\"|\\n|Object (non-standard exotic and does not implement [[Call]])\\t|Implementation-defined. Must not be \\\"undefined\\\", \\\"boolean\\\",  \\\"function\\\", \\\"number\\\", \\\"symbol\\\", or \\\"string\\\".|\\n\\n另外，如果直接用`typeof`来判断 NaN 的话，它会返回`\\\"number\\\"`，对于 NaN 我们可以用`isNaN`方法来判断是否一个数字。\\n```JavaScript\\ntypeof NaN; // \\\"number\\\"\\nisNaN(NaN); // true\\n```\\n### Object.prototype.toString()\\n\\n我们可以利用`Object.prototype.toString.call()`或者`Object.prototype.toString.apply()`这两个方法判断 Object 的类型，以及 null：\\n```JavaScript\\nObject.prototype.toString.call(undefined);   // \\\"[object Undefined]\\\"\\nObject.prototype.toString.call(new Date);    // \\\"[object Date]\\\"\\nObject.prototype.toString.call(new String);  // \\\"[object String]\\\"\\nObject.prototype.toString.call(Math);        // \\\"[object Math]\\\"\\nObject.prototype.toString.call(null);        // \\\"[object Null]\\\"\\n```\\n\\nECMAScript 19.1.3.6 明确定义 Object.prototype.toString()：\\n\\n1.  If the `this` value is `undefined`, return `\\\"[object Undefined]\\\"`.\\n2.  If the `this` value is `null`, return `\\\"[object Null]\\\"`.\\n3.  Let `O` be ! [ToObject](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toobject)(`this` value).\\n4.  Let `isArray` be ? [IsArray](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-isarray)(`O`).\\n5.  If `isArray` is `true`, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"Array\\\"`.\\n6.  Else if `O` is a String exotic object, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"String\\\"`.\\n7.  Else if `O` has a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"Arguments\\\"`.\\n8.  Else if `O` has a [[Call]] internal method, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"Function\\\"`.\\n9.  Else if `O` has an [[ErrorData]] internal slot, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"Error\\\"`.\\n10.  Else if `O` has a [[BooleanData]] internal slot, let `builtinTag` be `\\\"Boolean\\\"`.\\n11.

加載組件\\n# headerImage: \\\"LEYYumy.jpg\\\"\\ntags:\\n  - React\\n  - Web\\ndate: 2017-05-16 22:40:00\\n---\\n\\n## 組件\\n`React`提供`React.Component`，我們可以透過使用組件，拆分UI為可以重複使用的獨立部分。`React.Component`是一個抽象的base class。我們甚少直接運用`React.Component`，通常是透過創建一個子類，並使用`render()`方法。\\n\\n例子：\\n```JavaScript\\nclass Greeting extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n如果你不選擇使用ES6，你可以使用模組`create-react-class`。你可以參考[React Without ES6](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-without-es6.html)。\\n下面這一段和ES6的寫法效果一樣：\\n```JavaScript\\nvar createReactClass = require('create-react-class');\\nvar Greeting = createReactClass({\\n  render: function() {\\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## 組件生命週期\\n\\n每一個組件都會有幾個生命週期的方法，你可以在程序運行的指定時間，透過覆蓋他們來運行特定代碼。對於這些方法，我們會用`will-`來表示它會在某些事情發生之前的一刻被調用，而`did-`則是表示它會在某些事情發生之後的一刻被調用。本文會細說加載組件中發生了什麼事情。\\n\\n### 加載 (Mounting)\\n1. `constructor()`\\n1. `componentWillMount()`\\n1. `render()`\\n1. `componentDidMount()`\\n\\n### 更新 (Updating)\\n當 props 或者 state 更新的時候，下面這些方法會被調用：\\n\\n1. componentWillReceiveProps()\\n1. shouldComponentUpdate()\\n1. componentWillUpdate()\\n1. render()\\n1. componentDidUpdate()\\n\\n### 斷開連接 (Unmounting)\\n當組件脫離DOM的時候，下面這個方法回被調用：\\n\\n1. componentWillUnmount()\\n\\n### 其他內置方法\\n1. setState()\\n1. forceUpdate()\\n\\n我們會在下文討論一下React是如何加載組件。\\n\\n{% img /img/react-mount.svg 300 auto React LifeCycle Mount %}\\n\\n#### constructor()\\n```JavaScript\\nconstructor(props)\\n```\\n\\n在React加載組件之前，它會調用`constructor`。你可以在`constructor`中去賦予組件的初始`state`。如果你使用`props`創造初始`state`的話，這也是可以接受的。這會很有效地`fork`組件的`props`，然後賦予初始`state`的值。\\n\\n有效的`constructor`例子：\\n```JavaScript\\nconstructor(props) {\\n  super(props);\\n  this.state = {\\n    color: props.initialColor\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### 注意事項\\n1. 如果你不需要賦予初始`state`，你不需要在 React 的組件中植入`constructor`。\\n1. 當你使用在`React.Component`的子類中加載`constructor()`方法時，你應該第一時間調用`super(props)`，而不是在任何statement之後。不然，我們獲取`this.props`值的時候，它會是`undefined`。\\n1. 在一些類似上面的例子，`state`未必會及時與任何的`props`更新。如果你需要同步`state`的話，你其實是想要[lift the state up](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lifting-state-up.html)。\\n\\n#### componentWillMount()\\n```JavaScript\\ncomponentWillMount()\\n```\\n\\n它會在組件`render()`之前執行一次，然後不能再執行。如果在這裡定義了`setState`方法，頁面只會在加載之前更新一次，不會重複渲染。React 官方推薦使用`constructor()`代替這個方法。\\n\\n#### render()\\n`React.Component`必須有這個方法，即使你返回`null`，或者`false`。當你返回`null`，或者`false`的時候，`ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this)` 會返回`null`。\\n\\n當它被調用的時候，它會檢查`this.props`和`this.state`，然後返回一個單獨的 React 元素。這個元素會是一個純正的`DOM`組件，例如<div />，或者自定義的 composite 組件。\\n\\n##### 注意事項\\n1. `render()`方法應該是`pure`：它不會改寫任何組件的`state`。每一次調用它都會返回同樣的結果。它不會直接接觸到瀏覽器層面。\\n1. 如果你需要接觸到瀏覽器層面，你應該在`componentDidMount()`或者其他生命週期方法中接觸瀏覽器。\\n1. 保持`render()`方法 pure 來讓組件更加容易被人理解。\\n\\n#### componentDidMount()\\n```JavaScript\\ncomponentDidMount()\\n```\\n\\n它會在組件加載之後執行一次。如果你的初始程序需要DOM nodes，你應該在這裡寫。如果你需要從其他地方加載資料，這裡也是一個不錯的地方去執行網絡請求。如果在這裡定義了`setState`方法，會觸發重複渲染。\\n\\n#### 測試代碼\\n```JavaScript\\nclass Greeting extends React.Component {\\n  _log(method, args) {\\n    console.log(method, args);\\n  }\\n\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n    console.log('constructor', props);\\n  }\\n\\n  render() {\\n    this._log('render', this.props.name);\\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\\n  }\\n\\n  componentWillMount() {\\n    this._log('componentWillMount');\\n  }\\n\\n  componentDidMount() {\\n    this._log('componentDidMount');\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(\\n  <Greeting name=\\\"Calpa\\\" />,\\n  document.getElementById('app')\\n);\\n```\\n\\nConsole Output:\\n```\\n\\\"constructor\\\" Object {\\n  name: \\\"Calpa\\\"\\n}\\n\\\"componentWillMount\\\" undefined\\n\\\"render\\\" \\\"Calpa\\\"\\n\\\"componentDidMount\\\" undefined\\n```\\n\\n你可以在[CodePen](https://codepen.io/calpa/full/xdJrQm/)中獲取，並測試這段代碼。\\n\\n不知道拿哪一張當封面好。。。\\n\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"React 組件生命週期 -

你的 Markdown 來源（必須）- string\\n* `className` - 容器的 className - string\\n* `containerTagName` - 容器的標籤名字 ，因為 Markdown 會有很多不同層次的 elements，容器需要把它們封裝。默認是`div` - string\\n\\n這個渲染器會渲染的組件有：\\n\\n* `HtmlInline` - 行內 HTML\\n* `HtmlBlock` - HTML 塊\\n* `Text` - 文字 (在段落裡面)\\n* `Paragraph` - 段落 (`<p>`)\\n* `Heading` - 標題 (`<h1>`, `<h2>` etc)\\n* `Softbreak` - 換行\\n* `Hardbreak` - 斷行（強制換行） (`<br>`)\\n* `Link` - 鏈接 (`<a>`)\\n* `Image` - 圖像 (`<img>`)\\n* `Emph` - 強調 (`<em>`)\\n* `Code` - Inline code nodes (`<code>`)\\n* `CodeBlock` - Blocks of code (`<code>`)\\n* `BlockQuote` - 參照 (`<blockquote>`)\\n* `List` - 列表 (`<ol>`, `<ul>`)\\n* `Item` - 列表 (`<li>`)\\n* `Strong` - Strong/bold nodes (`<strong>`)\\n* `ThematicBreak` - 水平分割線 (`<hr>`)\\n\\n## Markdown 語法\\n\\nMarkdown 的目標是易讀易寫，而它能夠幫助程序員專注開發，減少編寫文檔時候遇到的格式問題。Markdown 和 HTML 的寫法差不多，雖然 HTML 已經很容易寫，但是 Markdown 則是更加格式化，如果你直接閱讀 Markdown 文檔，你也可以想象到它渲染後的樣式。\\n\\n### 標題\\n```\\n# H1\\n## H2\\n### H3\\n```\\n\\n### 清單\\n無序清單使用`*`, `+` 或`-`，而我這是常用`-`\\n```\\n*   Red\\n*   Green\\n*   Blue\\n\\n+   Red\\n+   Green\\n+   Blue\\n\\n-   Red\\n-   Green\\n-   Blue\\n```\\n有序清單則使用數字接著一個英文句點：\\n```\\n1.  Apple\\n2.  Banana\\n3.  Watermelon\\n```\\n\\n## 後記\\n\\n順帶說一下，我的博客已經配置好 Service Worker，現在可以離線訪問網站。也就是下次訪問的時候，即使沒有 Wifi 或者連接到網絡，你也能夠瀏覽到文章內容。\\n\\n有機會的話，我會說說如何配置 Service Worker，以及當中的原理。\\n\\n我的簡歷也差不多重構一次了（逃。。。\\n\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"React-markdown -- 實時渲染 Markdown 的 React 工具\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/react-markdown-render-markdown-as-component/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/2017-08-31-react-markdown-render-markdown-as-component.json\n// module id = 518\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"tableOfContents\":\"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#%E5%8F%83%E8%80%83%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99\\\">參考資料</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"internal\":{\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: 【React Native】安裝Android Apk而無需連接伺服器的方法\\ndate: 2017-04-11 17:41\\ntags:\\n  - React Native\\n---\\n\\n正常情況下，我們會用命令`react-native run-android`來在自己的電話中測試app，但是這個方法需要連接電腦。\\n\\n我們可以利用以下命令：\\n```\\nreact-native bundle --dev false --platform android --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output ./android/app/build/intermediates/assets/debug/index.android.bundle --assets-dest ./android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug\\n\\ncd android\\n./gradlew assembleDebug\\n```\\n\\n## 參考資料\\n1.

Google / Bing 一下\\n\\n  ![Google 一下](https://i.imgur.com/1Djy0Gj.png)\\n\\n  問題就是答案，其實你直接在搜尋引擎搜尋，就會找到這些問題的解決方法。如果你問我一些技術的問題，我很可能會直接叫你 Google，因為有時候第一個搜尋結果就是你的答案。如果你已經找過，但是找不到的話，很大機會是你的搜尋字不對，你可以加一下你的項目的 package，比如說 把 react, bootstrap 等字眼加在搜尋裡面。\\n\\n### 3. 閱讀官方資料\\n\\n  ![Calpa's Blog Github Repo](https://i.imgur.com/kmFRumd.png)\\n\\n  先閱讀 Github上面的 README.md，然後閱讀官網上對於該項目的簡介，使用方法，再看 API。你可以再看一次 Github Repo 的說明，看看有沒有自己沒注意到的地方。你也可以直接進入官網，然後看它對於各個方法，變量的說明。如果你看不到你想要的方法，你可以返回第二步，Google 一下。\\n\\n### 4. 查看 Issue\\n\\n  如果你還是搜不到的話，看看人家有沒有遇到類似的問題，並從中獲取靈感。\\n\\n### 5. 閱讀源代碼\\n\\n  有時候，開源項目的作者寫得比較匆忙，急著都沒有寫好文檔，以及測試代碼。這個時候，你直接看上面的代碼吧。。。\\n\\n  如果是部署在 Github 上面的話，可以使用在線代碼搜尋插件，比如說 [Insight.io for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insightio-for-github/pmhfgjjhhomfplgmbalncpcohgeijonh)。如果你已經把它 clone 下來的話，可以使用流行的編輯器進行全局搜尋，例如 Atom，Sublime。\\n\\n  ![Insight.io](https://i.imgur.com/OWuA4xP.png)\\n\\n  另外，你也可以使用 [lambda-view](https://github.com/Jianru-Lin/lambda-view)，閱讀 JavaScript 源代碼時，這個很好用的。\\n  ![lambda-view](https://i.imgur.com/kmuI2NX.png)\\n\\n### 6. 出去走走，喝點水\\n\\n  ![喝點水，休息一下](https://i.imgur.com/oXlUIRt.gif)\\n\\n  如果你看了網上的解決方法，但覺得無從入手的話，出去走一走，喝一口水，讓大腦休息一下。有時候，我上午想不到的問題，吃個午餐，然後下午就想到解決方法了。\\n\\n## 禮貌地提出問題\\n\\n  如果你做了以上的步驟，還是沒有辦法解決問題的話，你可以去 Repo 的 Issue 上面說一下，先不要直接說我找到一個 bug。。。\\n\\n## 後記\\n\\n感覺很長時間沒有寫博客了，文筆開始生疏。這一篇文章寫的時間比以前長，可能我要努力一點才行。。。\\n\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"項目代碼調試：提問前要做的六個步驟\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/six-steps-to-debug-before-directly-ask-question/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/2017-07-24-six-steps-to-debug-before-directly-ask-question.json\n// module id = 521\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"tableOfContents\":\"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#%E5%8F%83%E8%80%83%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99\\\">參考資料</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"internal\":{\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Redux push()是怎樣寫的？\\nheaderImage: 'eySAMI1.jpg'\\ndate: 2017-05-03 23:20\\ntags:\\n  - JavaScript\\n  - Redux\\n---\\n\\n本來你可以直接改寫原本的數組，比如利用這個方法：`arr.push(item)`。\\n但在Redux裡面不可以這樣寫，因為會改寫原本數組，違反了immutable的原則。\\n因此，要這樣寫： `arr: [...state.arr, action.newItem]`。\\n\\n例子：\\n```\\nimport { ADD_ITEM } from '../Actions/UserActions'\\nconst initialUserState = {\\n  arr: []\\n}\\n\\nexport default function userState(state = initialUserState, action) {\\n  console.log(arr);\\n  switch (action.type) {\\n    case ADD_ITEM:\\n      return {\\n        ...state,\\n        arr: [...state.arr, action.newItem]\\n      }\\n\\n    default:\\n      return state;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n另外，你也可以利用`concat()`方法。\\n\\n## 參考資料\\n1.

Blog\\ndate: 2017-05-30 20:00:00\\n---\\n\\n從第一篇[《Hello World》](https://calpa.me/2017/01/08/hello-world/)文章，我已經開始寫博客半年了，一共寫三十多篇，平均一個禮拜出一篇文章。其實，我沒有想那麼多，直接就開始寫文章了。可能我的博客沒有其他人寫得那麼好，但是我依然堅持寫博客。每一篇文章是需要一點時間構思、撰寫，但是這點時間是很值得的。\\n\\n## 原因\\n\\n1. 重用問題解決方案\\n  我們在寫代碼的時候，經常會遇到一些問題，不是那麼容易直接去解決，每次都是用同樣，或差不多的解決方法。如果每一次去 Google 這些問題，就會顯得有點浪費時間了。透過博客記錄下來，我們可以很方便地讓自己重用這些方案，同時讓別人避免造同樣的輪子。\\n\\n1. 學習知識\\n\\n  分享是學習知識的其中一種好方法。透過分享知識，我們可以整理碎片化的知識，並把它組合起來成為一篇文章。如果有小夥伴指出那篇文章的問題，大家可以交流一下，互相提升技術水平。\\n\\n1. 整理思維\\n\\n  作為一個 Web 前端程序員，經常會接觸網絡上日新月異的工具，知識。如果可以整理他們出來，就可以更好地讓自己摸清脈絡，對他們有更好的認識。\\n\\n1. 了解自己\\n\\n  就如同寫日記一樣，寫博客是一個不錯的方法去尋找自己的路。我們可能會有很多的興趣，但只有一樣或數樣是真愛。如果把自己的興趣和學習的歷程寫下來，就會知道什麼才是自己持之以恆想做的事情，自己的熱情在哪裡。\\n\\n1. 認識不同的讀者\\n\\n  如果博客可以吸引讀者，這就代表文章的質量開始上升。透過與不同的人交流，學習不同的思想。寫著寫著博客文章，我開始和國內，台灣的程序員打開了溝通的渠道，博客也有開始有來自世界各地，包括日本，美國的讀者。\\n\\n## 最初的動機\\n\\n以前看到一些大牛經常發文，我就想：可不可以有一天我也可以發文呢？一開始我是打算把自己看到的好文章節錄出來，以及記錄自己遇到的坑，然後讓自己日後重用。沒有想到的是，那篇[《打好 JavaScript 的6個步驟》](https://calpa.me/2017/05/21/learn-javascript-in-six-steps/)會為博客在兩日之內帶來 2000 多的流量，讓我感到有點高興。今後應該會繼續寫博客，記錄一下自己學了什麼。\\n\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"為什麼要寫技術博客？\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/why-i-write-blog-posts/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/2017-05-31-why-i-write-blog-posts.json\n// module id = 529\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"tableOfContents\":\"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#padding\\\">padding</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#line-height\\\">line-height</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#table\\\">table</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#flexbox\\\">Flexbox</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#%E5%BB%B6%E4%BC%B8%E9%96%B1%E8%AE%80\\\">延伸閱讀</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"internal\":{\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: CSS垂直置中的4種方法\\ndate: 2017-05-06 12:59:00\\ntags: CSS\\n---\\n\\n這是一道送分題，如果想要垂直置中元素的話，起碼會有四種方法：**padding**, **line-height**, **table** 和 **Flexbox**。使用Flexbox的話，日後要更改元素的位置會非常方便。\\n\\n## padding\\n如果你要置中的元素是`inine`或者是`inline-*`的話，比如說文字和鏈接，你可以用**padding**來實現垂直置中：\\n```\\n.vCenter {\\n  padding-top: 30px;\\n  padding-bottom: 30px;\\n  background: #eee;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n```\\n因為`padding-top`和`padding-bottom`的數值是一樣，所以我們可以透過這個方法來實現垂直置中。\\n<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='padding 垂直置中' src='//codepen.io/calpa/embed/pPdowv/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/calpa/pen/pPdowv/'>padding 垂直置中</a> by Calpa Liu (<a href='http://codepen.io/calpa'>@calpa</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n## line-height\\n```\\n.anotherCenter {\\n  height: 100px;\\n  line-height: 100px;\\n  background: #6cf;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n```\\n如果你不想用`padding`來實現垂直置中的話，你可以利用`line-height`等於`height`。\\n\\n<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='line-height 垂直置中' src='//codepen.io/calpa/embed/JNOjJJ/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/calpa/pen/JNOjJJ/'>line-height 垂直置中</a> by Calpa Liu (<a href='http://codepen.io/calpa'>@calpa</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n## table\\n\\n你可以透過`valign`來控制位置。\\n\\n另外，你可以利用`display: table-cell`來改變顯示的方式。\\n```\\n.fakeTable {\\n  height: 200px;\\n  width: 200px;\\n  display: table-cell;\\n  border: 1px solid black;\\n  text-align: center;\\n  vertical-align: middle;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='Table 垂直置中' src='//codepen.io/calpa/embed/xdPxLr/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/calpa/pen/xdPxLr/'>Table 垂直置中</a> by Calpa Liu (<a href='http://codepen.io/calpa'>@calpa</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n## Flexbox\\n另外，你也可以使用**Flexbox**來實現垂直置中，只需要寫justify-content和align-items就可以了。\\n```\\n.vertical-center {\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n}\\n```\\n<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='FlexBox 垂直置中' src='//codepen.io/calpa/embed/NjwWjV/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/calpa/pen/NjwWjV/'>FlexBox 垂直置中</a> by Calpa Liu (<a href='http://codepen.io/calpa'>@calpa</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\\n</iframe>\\n\\n## 延伸閱讀\\n1.
